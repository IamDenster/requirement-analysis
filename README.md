# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering and defining the functions, features, and constraints of a software system. It focuses on answering the fundamental questions:
1. What problem needs to be solved?
2. What are the goals of the users and stakeholders?
3. What should the system do (functional requirements)?
4. What qualities should the system have (non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, usability)?

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering:
Collected from stakeholders like clients, users, managers, and developers using interviews, surveys, questionnaires, workshops, or document reviews.

2. Requirement Elicitation:
Digging deeper into the gathered information to understand the true needs and expectations.

3. Requirement Analysis and Classification:
Sorting requirements into categories:

    1. Functional requirements: What the system should do (e.g., user login, data processing).
    2. Non-functional requirements: How the system should behave (e.g., response time, security, reliability).
    3. Domain-specific requirements: Industry-specific standards or rules.

4. Feasibility Study:
Evaluating technical, economic, legal, and operational feasibility to ensure the project is realistic and achievable.

5. Requirement Documentation:
Creating a formal document called the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), which serves as an agreement between stakeholders and developers.

6. Requirement Validation:
Ensuring that the requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, testable, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Foundation for Design and Development: It provides the blueprint for system design and coding. Without clear requirements, developers may build the wrong system.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: Documented requirements help in managing changes and prevent uncontrolled additions to the project scope.
3. Improves Cost and Time Efficiency: Fixing errors in later stages (design, development, or testing) is far more expensive than resolving them during requirement analysis.
4. Enhances Communication: Creates a common understanding between stakeholders and the development team, reducing misinterpretations.
5. Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction: Well-defined and validated requirements lead to software that meets user needs and performs reliably.
6. Facilitates Testing: Requirements act as the basis for creating test cases and validating whether the software works as intended.

# Types of Requirements
1. Functional requirements: What the system should do (e.g., user login, data processing).
2. Non-functional requirements: How the system should behave (e.g., response time, security, reliability).
3. Domain-specific requirements: Industry-specific standards or rules.

# Use Case Diagrams
A Use Case Diagram is a type of behavioral diagram defined by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It provides a high-level, graphical view of the system's intended functionality .

Its primary purpose is to illustrate the functional requirements of a system by showing actors (users or other systems) and the use cases (the specific actions or goals they can perform) they interact with. The system's boundary is typically represented by a box that contains the use cases.

# Benefits in Requirement Analysis
Use Case Diagrams are invaluable during requirement analysis for several reasons:
    1. Communication: They provide a simple, easily understood way for technical and non-technical stakeholders (like customers, developers, and testers) to agree on the system's scope and functionality.
    2. Defining Scope: The diagram clearly defines the system boundary, distinguishing what the system will do from what it will not do.\
    3. Eliciting Requirements: By focusing on the goals of the actors, analysts can more effectively identify and detail the functional requirements necessary to fulfill each use case.
    4. Planning & Prioritization: They offer a foundation for test cases (each use case should be testable) and help in prioritizing development efforts based on the value and frequency of the use cases.

# Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders.

# How to Define Acceptance Criteria:
1. Be specific and measurable
2. Include functional and non-functional aspects.
3. Example for Booking System: “Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.”

# Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:
1. Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
2. Provide a basis for testing and validation.
3. Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
