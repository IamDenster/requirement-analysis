# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering and defining the functions, features, and constraints of a software system. It focuses on answering the fundamental questions:
1. What problem needs to be solved?
2. What are the goals of the users and stakeholders?
3. What should the system do (functional requirements)?
4. What qualities should the system have (non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, usability)?

# Steps in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering:
Collected from stakeholders like clients, users, managers, and developers using interviews, surveys, questionnaires, workshops, or document reviews.

2. Requirement Elicitation:
Digging deeper into the gathered information to understand the true needs and expectations.

3. Requirement Analysis and Classification:
Sorting requirements into categories:

    1. Functional requirements: What the system should do (e.g., user login, data processing).
    2. Non-functional requirements: How the system should behave (e.g., response time, security, reliability).
    3. Domain-specific requirements: Industry-specific standards or rules.

4. Feasibility Study:
Evaluating technical, economic, legal, and operational feasibility to ensure the project is realistic and achievable.

5. Requirement Documentation:
Creating a formal document called the Software Requirement Specification (SRS), which serves as an agreement between stakeholders and developers.

6. Requirement Validation:
Ensuring that the requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, testable, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Foundation for Design and Development: It provides the blueprint for system design and coding. Without clear requirements, developers may build the wrong system.
2. Prevents Scope Creep: Documented requirements help in managing changes and prevent uncontrolled additions to the project scope.
3. Improves Cost and Time Efficiency: Fixing errors in later stages (design, development, or testing) is far more expensive than resolving them during requirement analysis.
4. Enhances Communication: Creates a common understanding between stakeholders and the development team, reducing misinterpretations.
5. Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction: Well-defined and validated requirements lead to software that meets user needs and performs reliably.
6. Facilitates Testing: Requirements act as the basis for creating test cases and validating whether the software works as intended.
